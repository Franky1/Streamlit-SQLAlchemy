# avatar_generator

This is a copy of the [avatar-generator](https://github.com/maethor/avatar-generator) package, but with some modifications to make it work, because the original pypi package was not working.

> :warning: **This is not the original package!** :warning:
>
> :point_right: It is not used in this project anymore, but it is here just in case.

## Issues :bug:

- Original package is not working, because the font file is missing in the pypi package
- Original package is not maintained anymore
- Modified package requires Pillow Version `pillow<10` to work, due to breaking changes in Pillow 10
